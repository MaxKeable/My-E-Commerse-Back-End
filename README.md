# Overview

## The Task

## The Challenge:
This challenge requires the creation of an e-commerce back-end site that meets specific user requirements. These requirements include the ability to connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize, create a development database that is seeded with test data, sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database, and display data from categories, products, and tags in a formatted JSON. The application should also be able to create, update, and delete data in the database.

## User Story
```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```


## Usage Instructions

1. Repository: Open documentation run 'npm i' and update '.env'.
2. Create database: use the schema.sql file in the db folder with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
3. Run 'node ./seeds/index.js' to seed the database with test data. Then, run 'npm start' or 'nodemon' to start the server and sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database.
4. Generate a development database with test data, use the schema and seed commands.
5. Use Insomnia to test http://localhost:3001 with the following route end points API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags, ensuring successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the database.
